# Brendan Stevens

Hello and welcome. My name is Brendan, and I'm a high school math teacher who teaches many courses, including Personal Finance, Geometry, and Algebra, as well as Statistics and Calculus. I have a Bachelor's in Mathematics from the University of Kansas and a Master's Degree in Applied Statistics, Analytics, and Data Science. In addition to that, I also have... just a general liking for most things math-related, you know? Anyway, this landing page serves two primary purposes, listed below. You may click the link to take you to whichever pertains to your needs.

  1. [Student Resources]() for class and/or cool things. (Dead link - Currently under construction, students)
  2. [Data Science Portfolio](https://github.com/bstevens00/Data-Science-Portfolio) for interested parties and personal projects.

## Why does this github page exist?
In no particular order of importance:

  * To help organize some of my class resources as time goes on.
  * As a hobby, as I enjoy playing with machine learning models to answer data questions I have about the world.
  * For work-related inquiries from recruiters or potentially interested employers, so they've evidence of my data abilities.
