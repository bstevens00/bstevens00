# Brendan Stevens

Hello and welcome. My name is Brendan, and I'm Data Scientist working in Risk Adjustment, focusing on Data Visualization and Machine Learning Algorithms in the subfield of Health Insurance. Previously, I come from a background in secondary education, having taught Statistics, Calculus, Personal Finance, Geometry, and Algebra, as well as having been a coach for Basketball and Theater. I received a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics from the University of Kansas and a Master of Science in Applied Statistics, Analytics, and Data Science, and I have a general appreciation for most things math-related. Follow the link(s) below for more information.

Check out my [Data Science Portfolio](https://github.com/bstevens00/Data-Science-Portfolio) for employment inquiries.

## Why does this github page exist?
In no particular order of importance:

  * For work-related inquiries from recruiters or potentially interested employers, so they've evidence of my data abilities.
  * As a hobby, as I enjoy playing with machine learning models to answer data questions I have about the world.
