# Brendan Stevens

Hello and welcome. My name is Brendan, and I'm a high school math teacher who teaches many courses, including Personal Finance, Geometry, and Algebra, as well as Statistics and Calculus. I have a Bachelor's in Mathematics from the University of Kansas and a Master's Degree in Applied Statistics, Analytics, and Data Science. This landing page serves two primary purposes. You may click the link to take you to whichever pertains to your needs.

  1. [Student Resources]() pertaining to class and/or cool things.
  2. [Data Science Portfolio](https://github.com/bstevens00/Data-Science-Portfolio) for interested parties and personal projects.

## Why does this github page exist?
As stated above, first, to help organize some of my class resources as time goes on. Second, as a hobby, I enjoy playing with machine learning models to answer data questions I have about the world. And third, I'm fascinated by the field of machine learning and data science, and am open to work inquiries related to those fields, so recruiters or potentially interested employers have evidence of my data abilities.

## What languages are in this portfolio?
My projects are primarily written in English. But if you're asking about code, then R: Statistical Programming Language.
