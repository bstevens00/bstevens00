# Brendan Stevens

I'm Brendan from a small town in Kansas you've never heard of. I teach math to high school students, including Statistics and Calculus. I have a Bachelor's in Mathematics and a Master's Degree in Statistics, Analytics, and Data Science. As a hobby, I enjoy playing with machine learning models to answer data questions I have about the world. My projects are primarily written in the R: Statistical Programming Language. I'm also open to work in the field of Data Science and Analytics.
