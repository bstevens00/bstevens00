# Brendan Stevens

Hello and welcome. My name is Brendan, and I'm a high school math teacher who teaches many courses, including Personal Finance, Geometry, and Algebra, as well as Statistics and Calculus. I have a Bachelor's in Mathematics from the University of Kansas and a Master's Degree in Applied Statistics, Analytics, and Data Science. And, you know, just a general liking for all things math related, you know? Anyway, this landing page serves two primary purposes, listed below. You may click the link to take you to whichever pertains to your needs.

  1. [Student Resources]() for class and/or cool things.
  2. [Data Science Portfolio](https://github.com/bstevens00/Data-Science-Portfolio) for interested parties and personal projects.

## Why does this github page exist?
In no particular order of importance:

  * To help organize some of my class resources as time goes on.
  * As a hobby, as I enjoy playing with machine learning models to answer data questions I have about the world.\
  * For work-related inquiries from recruiters or potentially interested employers, so they've evidence of my data abilities.

## What languages are in this portfolio?
My projects are primarily written in Gibberish and English. But since you're likely asking about code, then R: Statistical Programming Language.
